# bugfinderTool

This bug finder tool can find three java patterns

1. Invalid String comparison
2. Empty catch statement
3. Return statement with postfix increment/decrement

We used existing java parser version 3.15.1 to develop this bug finder tool. This is a Java Project with maven build system.
Anyone can clone this repository and test their own project's src code.

You need to put your src files under FileToTest directory and run the main function.

That's it. You will be able to see the output written in console.
